(c) Wrong tomb: not plausible in a city where the tomb's location was public. (d) Legend: the earliest creed (1 Cor 15:3-8) dates to within 3-5 years of the crucifixion, before any legendary accretion could develop. (e) Swoon theory: a crucifixion survivor could not convince disciples he had conquered death.",
