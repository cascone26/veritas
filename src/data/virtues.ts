Faith is an act of the intellect assenting to divine truth by command of the will moved by God through grace (CCC 1814).",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, qq. 1-16. Thomas defines faith as the habit by which the intellect is determined to assent to things not seen, on the authority of God revealing. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (Hebrews 11:1). It is the first of the theological virtues because it is the foundation of the entire spiritual life.",

Hope keeps us from discouragement, sustains us during desolation, and opens our hearts in expectation of eternal beatitude.",

      "ST II-II, qq. 17-22. Thomas teaches that hope is a movement of the appetitive power toward a future good that is arduous but possible to obtain with divine help.

Charity is the form of all the virtues — it animates and gives supernatural merit to all other virtues (CCC 1822-1829). Without charity, the other virtues are dead.",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, qq. 23-46. Thomas calls charity the 'mother and root of all virtues' (mater et radix omnium virtutum) because it directs all virtues to their ultimate end — union with God.

Prudence is the 'charioteer of the virtues' — it guides the other virtues by setting rule and measure (CCC 1806). It is not mere caution or timidity but right reason applied to action (recta ratio agibilium).",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, qq. 47-56. Thomas identifies prudence as the most necessary of the cardinal virtues because without it, the other moral virtues cannot function properly.

It is the only cardinal virtue that perfects the will rather than the passions.",

      "ST II-II, qq. 57-122. Thomas's treatise on justice is the longest section of the Summa. He distinguishes commutative justice (between individuals), distributive justice (of the community toward individuals), and legal justice (of individuals toward the common good).

      "ST II-II, qq. 123-140. Thomas teaches that fortitude's principal act is endurance (sustinere), not attack (aggredi). The brave person endures difficulty for the sake of the good. Fortitude moderates both fear and daring. Its parts include magnanimity (greatness of soul), magnificence, patience, and perseverance. Martyrdom is fortitude's most perfect act.",

It manifests as an inordinate self-esteem, contempt for others, refusal to submit to God, and the desire to be one's own rule and measure. St. Augustine called pride 'the beginning of all sin' (Sirach 10:13).",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, q. 162. Thomas identifies pride as the queen and mother of all vices, distinct from vainglory (which is a species of pride). Pride is the root sin because every sin involves a turning away from God's rule, which is essentially what pride does. Its four species (from St. Gregory): thinking one has goods from oneself, thinking one deserves them, boasting of goods one does not have, and despising others.",

It includes both the excessive desire to acquire wealth and the excessive reluctance to part with it. Scripture warns that 'the love of money is the root of all evils' (1 Timothy 6:10).",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, q. 118. Thomas teaches that avarice is a sin against justice because the greedy person takes or retains more than their due. It is a capital sin because many other sins flow from it: treachery, fraud, falsehood, perjury, restlessness, violence, and hardness of heart. Avarice grows more dangerous with age, as the elderly tend to cling more tightly to material security.",

    description:
      "The disordered desire for or inordinate enjoyment of sexual pleasure. Lust separates the sexual act from its God-given purposes of union and procreation within marriage. It reduces persons to objects of pleasure and undermines the virtue of chastity. Lust clouds the intellect, weakens the will, and disorders the entire moral life.",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, q. 153. Thomas identifies lust as a capital vice because it gives rise to many other sins: blindness of mind, thoughtlessness, inconstancy, rashness, self-love, hatred of God, attachment to the present world, and horror of the future judgment. Its species include fornication, adultery, incest, sacrilege, and sins against nature.",

While anger in itself is a passion that can be morally neutral or even righteous (as when directed against genuine injustice), sinful wrath seeks revenge in a disproportionate, unjust, or uncontrolled manner. It manifests as rage, bitterness, vindictiveness, and the refusal to forgive.",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, q. 158. Thomas distinguishes sinful anger from righteous indignation. Anger becomes sinful in three ways: when one desires vengeance against the innocent, when one desires disproportionate punishment, or when the desire for vengeance is fueled by selfish motives rather than zeal for justice. From wrath arise quarreling, swelling of the mind, contumely, clamor, indignation, and blasphemy.",

      "The disordered desire for the pleasure of food and drink. Gluttony is not merely eating too much but any disordered relationship with food: eating too much, too expensively, too eagerly, too daintily, or at inappropriate times. It is a failure of temperance regarding the most basic bodily pleasure.",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, q. 148. Thomas lists five species of gluttony (using the medieval mnemonic praepropere, laute, nimis, ardenter, studiose): eating too soon, too expensively, too much, too eagerly, or too daintily. From gluttony arise dullness of mind, unseemly joy, scurrility, talkativeness, and uncleanness.",

Envy is directly opposed to charity, which rejoices in the good of others. It is particularly destructive because it poisons relationships and turns every blessing into a source of bitterness.",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, q. 36. Thomas defines envy as sadness at another's good. It is a capital sin because it gives rise to hatred, tale-bearing, detraction, joy at another's misfortune, and grief at another's prosperity. Envy is a sin against charity and is distinguished from holy zeal (which is sorrow at another's sin) and from competitive emulation (which desires to equal the good of others without begrudging it).",

      "Spiritual apathy or sorrow in the face of spiritual good. Sloth is not mere laziness but a deep aversion to the demands of divine friendship. It is disgust with the spiritual life, a torpor of soul that refuses the joy of God. The slothful person finds the effort of loving God burdensome and retreats into worldly distractions.",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, q. 35. Thomas defines acedia as 'sorrow about spiritual good insofar as it is a divine good' — a sadness about the very thing that should bring joy. It is a sin against the joy of charity. From sloth arise malice, spite, faint-heartedness, despair, sluggishness regarding the commandments, and wandering of the mind after unlawful things. The desert fathers considered acedia the 'noonday devil' (Psalm 91:6).",

Wisdom gives a connaturality with divine things — an experiential knowledge of God that goes beyond mere intellectual understanding. It corresponds to the beatitude 'Blessed are the peacemakers' because the wise soul orders all things to God, producing interior peace.",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, qq. 45. Thomas teaches that wisdom is the highest of the gifts because it judges all things by the highest cause — God Himself.

Understanding enables the soul to grasp the deeper meaning of Scripture, the mysteries of the faith, and the inner connections between revealed truths. It does not produce full comprehension (which belongs to the beatific vision) but a taste of the intelligibility hidden within faith's obscurity.",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, q. 8. Thomas distinguishes the gift of understanding from the intellectual virtue of the same name. The gift penetrates the inner truth of things proposed by faith — not by adding new content but by deepening our grasp of what we already believe.

Counsel goes beyond natural prudence by providing supernatural guidance in matters where human reason alone would be insufficient.",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, q. 52. Thomas teaches that while prudence enables us to reason correctly about practical matters, counsel enables us to be directed by God Himself in matters that exceed our natural capacity for deliberation.

While the natural virtue of fortitude enables us to face difficulties through our own moral strength (aided by grace), the gift of fortitude empowers the soul to do and suffer things that are beyond the capacity of human nature.",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, q. 139. Thomas teaches that the gift of fortitude supplies what the virtue of fortitude cannot: a confidence of overcoming all dangers by the help of the Holy Spirit.

Knowledge gives a right appreciation of temporal goods and evils in light of eternity.",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, q. 9. Thomas distinguishes the gift of knowledge from the gift of understanding: understanding penetrates divine truths themselves, while knowledge judges created things in relation to God.

Piety makes our worship warm and personal rather than merely dutiful.",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST II-II, q. 121. Thomas teaches that while the virtue of religion renders to God what is due in strict justice, the gift of piety moves us to relate to God with the tenderness of children toward a beloved father.

It is not servile fear (fear of punishment) but filial fear (fear of displeasing the One we love). The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 9:10) and the foundation of the spiritual life.",

The reward — 'they shall obtain mercy' — is both temporal (the experience of God's mercy in this life) and eternal (the definitive mercy of salvation).",

      "Purity of heart is the undivided intention of the soul directed entirely toward God. It is freedom not only from sins of the flesh but from all duplicity, guile, and divided loyalties. The pure in heart see God because nothing stands between their soul and the divine light — no idol, no disordered attachment, no self-deception.",

      "ST I-II, q. 69, a. 3. Thomas connects this beatitude to the gift of understanding, which penetrates the inner meaning of divine truth. Purity of heart removes the obstacles to spiritual vision. The reward — 'they shall see God' — refers to the beatific vision, the direct, face-to-face knowledge of God that is the ultimate happiness of the human person (ST I, q. 12).",

      "Peacemakers actively work to establish and restore right relationships — between persons, between communities, and between humanity and God. They do not merely avoid conflict but labor to bring about the tranquility of order (true peace). They are called children of God because they imitate the Son, who reconciled all things through the Cross (Colossians 1:20).",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST I-II, q. 69, a. 3. Thomas connects peacemaking to the gift of wisdom, which orders all things to their proper end and thereby produces peace. The title 'children of God' is fitting because peace is the fruit of conformity to the divine will, and those who bring peace share in God's own work of reconciliation.",

      "Those who suffer persecution for the sake of justice, truth, and fidelity to Christ are blessed because their suffering unites them to the Cross and guarantees their share in the Resurrection. Persecution for righteousness is the ultimate test of all the other beatitudes — the synthesis of poverty, mourning, meekness, hunger for justice, mercy, purity, and peacemaking under fire.",
    aquinasRef:
      "ST I-II, q. 69, a. 3. Thomas teaches that this beatitude is the consummation of all the others: it contains all the preceding beatitudes under the supreme trial of persecution. The reward — 'theirs is the kingdom of heaven' — echoes the first beatitude, forming an inclusion that encompasses the entire Sermon on the Mount. Martyrdom is the perfect act of this beatitude.",
